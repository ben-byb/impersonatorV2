# impersonator-extension

Chrome extension for hot-swapping impersonated users quickly.

## Setup

Clone the repo into your dev folder and then navigate to `chrome://extensions`. Enable developer mode and then click **Load unpacked**. Navigate to the new impersonator-extension folder and click open. The extension should be added to Chrome and should appear in the corner with an I to click on.

## Notes

 - Need to reset users once their JWT expires
 - If clicking store doesn't work just refresh the page and try again as this happens sometimes :<
 - Make sure to start impersonating a user before clicking store. You can also store your regular user to swap back to.
