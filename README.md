# impersonator-extension

Chrome extension for hot-swapping impersonated users quickly.

## Setup

## Notes

 - Need to reset users once their JWT expires
 - If clicking store doesn't work just refresh the page and try again as this happens sometimes :<
 - Make sure to start impersonating a user before clicking store. You can also store your regular user to swap back to.
